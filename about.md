# About G-Wiki

G-Wiki is a community-driven business directory that combines the ease of Google Sheets for data management with the power of GitHub Pages for hosting.

## How It Works

1. **Data Source**: All business information is stored in a collaborative Google Sheet
2. **Automatic Sync**: A script fetches data from Google Sheets and generates the website
3. **Static Site**: The site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages
4. **Community Driven**: Anyone can contribute by editing the Google Sheet

## Contributing

To add or update a business listing:

1. Access our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhvzfKKUWTmApBQDCrMpwrY0iYhWzugyMepPucsvF3Y)
2. Add or edit business information
3. The website will automatically update with your changes

## Data Structure

Our Google Sheet contains the following columns:

- **Name**: Business name
- **Category**: Type of business (e.g., Restaurant, Retail, Services)
- **Description**: Brief description of the business
- **Phone**: Contact phone number
- **Website**: Business website URL
- **Address**: Physical address
- **Additional Info**: Any extra information

## Technical Details

This site is built with:

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator
- **Google Sheets API**: For data sourcing
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting
- **Python**: For data synchronization scripts
